Dialogue: 10,0:04:04.30,0:04:05.80,Default,,0,0,0,,If the Log Pose needle is pointing upwards,
Dialogue: 10,0:04:06.80,0:04:09.77,Default,,0,0,0,,that means the log has been caught by the sky island.

Dialogue: 10,0:05:02.57,0:05:04.15,Default,,0,0,0,,No, Navigator.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:04.65,0:05:11.70,Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}Our concern right now should not be the Log Pose, \Nit should be how we get to the sky.

Dialogue: 10,0:05:42.98,0:05:46.45,Default,,0,0,0,,What's that woman doing, opening the coffin?!
Dialogue: 10,0:05:50.37,0:05:51.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Can you learn something from that?

Dialogue: 10,0:06:14.64,0:06:18.19,Default,,0,0,0,,I see... then this guy was \Npierced there and died, huh?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:18.45,0:06:21.40,Default,,0,0,0,,No, these are indications of medical treatment.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:21.40,0:06:23.90,Default,,0,0,0,,It's craterization, isn't it, Doctor?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:23.90,0:06:29.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, in the past, they made holes in the \Nskull in order to constrain a brain tumor.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:29.20,0:06:31.87,Default,,0,0,0,,But that's a medical technique from very long ago.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:32.28,0:06:36.70,Default,,0,0,0,,That's right. \NIt's been at least 200 years since he died.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:39.21,0:06:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,He was in his early 30s.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:44.34,0:06:47.72,Default,,0,0,0,,He fell sick while traveling on the sea and died.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:52.05,0:06:56.06,Default,,0,0,0,,The reason his teeth remained in good \Ncondition compared to his other bones is...
Dialogue: 10,0:06:58.43,0:07:00.39,Default,,0,0,0,,...because tar was rubbed onto them.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:00.39,0:07:04.36,Default,,0,0,0,,This custom is characteristic of \Nsome areas in the South Blue.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:04.36,0:07:09.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So considering history, that was a ship \Nfor an exploration party from the past.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:11.78,0:07:16.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Here it is. The "St. Briss" of Briss, \Na kingdom in the South Blue.

Dialogue: 10,0:07:28.21,0:07:31.05,Default,,0,0,0,,You can find out all that \Njust by looking at bones?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:31.93,0:07:35.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Dead people may not speak, \Nbut they do hold information.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:35.39,0:07:37.10,Default,,0,0,0,,If the ship was for an exploration party,
Dialogue: 10,0:07:37.10,0:07:40.43,Default,,0,0,0,,it should still hold various records and evidence.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:40.43,0:07:43.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah... but the ship sank in the sea...
Dialogue: 10,0:07:43.32,0:07:46.44,Default,,0,0,0,,What're you guys doing?!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:43.85,0:07:46.22,Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}Luffy! Hang in there!

Dialogue: 10,0:08:53.17,0:08:56.05,Default,,0,0,0,,If a huge ship like that really went to the sky,
Dialogue: 10,0:08:56.05,0:08:58.80,Default,,0,0,0,,then there's definitely a way \Nfor this ship to go there as well.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:59.35,0:09:03.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Let's somehow pull out whatever \Nrecords remain in that ship!
Dialogue: 10,0:09:04.14,0:09:07.10,Default,,0,0,0,,But the ship has completely sunk.

Dialogue: 10,0:09:17.86,0:09:20.95,Default,,0,0,0,,But it won't work, since that ship is too big.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:28.04,0:09:32.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, well... \NYou really make us do reckless things.
Dialogue: 10,0:09:32.17,0:09:32.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Er...
